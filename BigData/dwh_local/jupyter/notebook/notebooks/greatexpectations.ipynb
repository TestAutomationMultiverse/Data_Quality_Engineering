    "# Great Expectations (GX)\n",
    "is an open-source framework that has become popular for managing and automating data validation in modern data pipelines\n",
    "https://www.datacamp.com/courses/understanding-modern-data-architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "Its Python-based framework is designed to help data teams guarantee the quality and consistency of their data. Users can define \"expectations\"—rules or tests that describe what valid data should look like—that automatically validate whether the data meets these standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits of Great Expectations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Automated data validation –  Great Expectations automates the process of validating data, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of errors. It ensures that data consistently meets predefined standards.\n",
    "-   Integration with data pipelines – It easily integrates with various data sources and platforms, including SQL databases, cloud storage, and [ETL tools](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/a-list-of-the-16-best-etl-tools-and-why-to-choose-them), allowing for data validation across different stages of your pipeline.\n",
    "-   Clear, actionable validation results – The tool provides transparent validation results, making it easy to spot data quality issues and address them quickly.\n",
    "-   Data documentation – Great Expectations can generate detailed, accessible documentation of your data validation processes, helping teams align on quality standards and providing a reference for future use.\n",
    "-   Scalability and flexibility – As an open-source tool, Great Expectations is highly customizable and can scale with your data validation needs, offering flexibility to adjust to various use cases without high costs.\n",
