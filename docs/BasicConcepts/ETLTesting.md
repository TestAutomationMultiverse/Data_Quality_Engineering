Inconsistencies can arise from data integration issues or discrepancies in data recording practices. Data consistency checks aim to align information across the organization.
4.  **Timeliness** Timeliness measures how current and up-to-date the data is, ensuring that it remains relevant for its intended use. Outdated information can lead to incorrect analyses or decisions. Timeliness checks involve assessing whether data is regularly updated to reflect the latest changes.
5.  **Validity** Validity assesses whether data adheres to predefined rules, standards, or formats, ensuring that it meets the required criteria. Invalid data may result from input errors or deviations from established standards. Validation checks confirm that data conforms to the specified criteria.
6.  **Reliability** Reliability measures the trustworthiness of data sources and the consistency of the data, ensuring it is free from bias and error. Unreliable data sources can introduce inaccuracies. Reliability checks involve evaluating the credibility of data providers and assessing the consistency of data over time.
7.  **Precision** Precision refers to the level of detail or granularity present in numerical data. Precision ensures that numerical values are recorded with the appropriate level of detail, such as the correct number of decimal places. It is crucial for maintaining the accuracy of quantitative analyses.
8.  **Uniqueness** Uniqueness ensures that there are no duplicate records or instances within a dataset. Duplicate data can lead to overcounting or other errors in analysis. Uniqueness checks involve identifying and eliminating duplicate entries.
9.  **Relevance** Relevance assesses the applicability and usefulness of data for its intended purpose.Data that is not relevant to a particular analysis or decision-making process may introduce noise. Regularly evaluating the relevance of data helps maintain its usefulness.
10.  **Accessibility** Accessibility measures how easily authorized users can access and retrieve the required data.Difficulty in accessing data can hinder productivity. Accessibility checks ensure that data is stored in a manner that allows efficient retrieval by authorized personnel.

### Why Do Data Quality Dimensions Matter?

### Examples of data quality checks using SQL

**E-commerce Order Processing:**

-   Data Quality Check: Validity
-   Scenario: In an e-commerce system, there is a database of customer orders. A validity check ensures that all orders have a valid shipping address.
-   Example Query:

Copy`SELECT * FROM orders WHERE shipping_address IS NULL  OR shipping_address = '';`

-   This query identifies orders with missing or empty shipping addresses, helping maintain the validity of the data.

**Healthcare Patient Records:**

-   Data Quality Check: Accuracy
-   Scenario: In a healthcare system, patient records include information about medical conditions. An accuracy check ensures that the recorded diagnoses accurately reflect the patient's health.
