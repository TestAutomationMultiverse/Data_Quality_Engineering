Database management is a complex but critical aspect of modern IT operations. Databases are the backbone of many applications and systems, and ensuring their optimal performance and reliability is essential for businesses to succeed. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore both database monitoring and optimization strategies to help you maintain a healthy and high-performing relational database management system (RDBMS).

# Section 1: The Importance of Database Monitoring

# 1.1 Why Proactive Monitoring Matters

Database monitoring is the continuous process of scrutinizing the day-to-day operational status of your database system. Regardless of the vendor’s product you are using, database monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of your RDBMS. Here’s why proactive monitoring is essential:

Early Issue Detection: Regular database monitoring helps identify issues in a timely manner, preventing them from evolving into major problems. This proactive approach ensures the availability and reliability of your database.

User Confidence: Failing to monitor your database adequately can lead to undetected problems, resulting in service disruptions and loss of user confidence. Consistent monitoring instills trust in your services.

Optimization: Monitoring provides valuable insights for optimizing your database elements, ensuring the best possible performance. It helps you identify areas that need reconfiguration or optimization, even when everything seems to be working well.

# 1.2 Reactive vs. Proactive Monitoring

Before delving into the specifics of monitoring, it’s essential to understand the difference between reactive and proactive monitoring:

Reactive Monitoring: This approach involves addressing issues after they have already occurred. It typically occurs in response to critical events like security breaches, severe performance degradation, or other major incidents.

Proactive Monitoring: Proactive monitoring aims to prevent issues from arising in the first place. It involves continuously observing key metrics, setting up alerts, and taking actions before minor problems escalate into major disruptions. Proactive monitoring is the preferred strategy for most database administrators.

# Section 2: Establishing Performance Baselines

# 2.1 The Significance of Baseline Data

To gauge the effectiveness of your database monitoring and optimization efforts, you must establish a performance baseline. This involves recording key performance metrics at regular intervals over a specific time period. Here’s why baseline data is crucial:

Performance Comparison: Baseline statistics serve as a reference point for evaluating your database’s current performance. Deviations from this baseline can signal potential issues.

Operational Norms: Baseline data helps establish operational norms, such as peak and off-peak hours, typical response times, and the duration of backup and restore operations.

# 2.2 Key Areas Impacting Database Performance

Several factors significantly affect the performance of your database system:

> System Hardware Resources: Ensure that your hardware resources, including servers, storage, and network components, are efficiently utilized.
> 
> Network Architecture: A well-designed network architecture can contribute to optimal database performance.
> 
> Operating System: The OS plays a critical role in database operations, so it should be well-maintained and configured for optimal performance.
> 
> Database Applications: Optimize your applications to interact efficiently with the database.
> 
> Client Applications: Ensure that client applications are well-designed and don’t introduce bottlenecks.

# Section 3: Database Monitoring Methods

# 3.1 Real-Time Monitoring

Real-time monitoring allows you to view the current state of various database elements using monitoring table functions. These functions provide instant insights into aspects like space usage, query performance, and index utilization. They are lightweight and offer high-speed monitoring.

SQL Command Example:

\-- Check tablespace usage in real-time  
SELECT \* FROM sys.tablespace\_usage;

# 3.2 Event Monitoring

Event monitoring captures historical information as specific types of database events occur over time. It can be configured to log various events, such as locks, deadlocks, or threshold exceedances. Event monitors generate output in different formats and can be invaluable for diagnosing issues after the fact.

SQL Command Example:

\-- Set up an event monitor to track deadlocks  
CREATE EVENT MONITOR deadlock\_events FOR DEADLOCKS;

# Section 4: Monitoring at Different Levels

# 4.1 Understanding the Four Levels of Monitoring

Efficient database monitoring involves tracking your system at four distinct levels:

> 1\. Infrastructure Level: This level focuses on the underlying infrastructure components like servers, storage, and network. Ensuring their efficiency is essential for maintaining consistent database performance.
> 
> 2\. Platform (Instance) Level: Monitoring at this level provides holistic insights into all elements required for stable database performance. Regardless of the RDBMS used, monitoring the database platform is crucial.
> 
> 3\. Query Level: Your line-of-business applications often run numerous queries against the database. Inefficient queries can lead to latency and reduced throughput. Monitoring at this level helps optimize query performance.
> 
> 4\. User (Session) Level: While users may not always complain about issues, continuous monitoring at this level is vital. Proactively identifying problems before users notice them is the ultimate goal of database monitoring.

# 4.2 Maintaining Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Monitoring at all four levels is essential for meeting service level agreements (SLAs), such as high availability, uptime, and low latency. A robust monitoring strategy ensures your database consistently delivers optimal performance.

# Section 5: Database Optimization

Database optimization is the process of fine-tuning your database to improve response times, reduce bottlenecks, and enhance overall performance. Let’s explore the strategies for optimizing your database.

# 5.1 Why Database Optimization Is Crucial

As your database grows and operational workloads increase, data can become fragmented, tables may remain partially empty, and overall performance can suffer. Database optimization addresses these issues to maintain peak performance.

# 5.2 Optimization Techniques for Different RDBMS

Each RDBMS provides specific utilities or commands for optimizing databases:

-   MySQL: Use the `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command to reorganize data and improve I/O efficiency. It's particularly useful for tables with frequent insert, update, or delete operations.

SQL Command Example:

\-- Optimize a table in MySQL  
OPTIMIZE TABLE your\_table\_name;

-   PostgreSQL: Employ the `VACUUM` and `REINDEX` commands to perform garbage collection, reclaim lost storage space, and rebuild indexes.

SQL Command Example:

\-- Perform vacuuming and reindexing in PostgreSQL  
VACUUM FULL;  
REINDEX;

-   Db2: Utilize the `RUNSTATS` command to update statistics and the `REORG` command to reorganize tables for optimal performance.

SQL Command Example:

\-- Update statistics and reorganize tables in Db2  
RUNSTATS ON TABLE your\_table\_name;  
REORG TABLE your\_table\_name;

# 5.3 Best Practices for Indexing

Indexing is a crucial aspect of database optimization. Here are some best practices to consider:

Understand Database Usage: Tailor your indexing strategy based on how the database will be used. Consider frequently executed queries and their requirements.

Column Characteristics: Consider the data types and uniqueness of columns when designing indexes.

Index Types: Choose between primary, unique, and non-unique indexes based on your specific needs.

Storage Placement: Carefully select where to store indexes to optimize disk I/O operations.

Experiment and Monitor: Continuously test and adjust your indexing strategy, monitoring its impact on query performance and index maintenance overhead.

&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Since databases power every organization’s business-critical apps and services, database monitoring is a vital part of database management. Database performance issues such as slow queries or too many open connections can slow down these apps and services or make them temporarily unavailable — affecting end user experience. Database monitoring gives teams insight into software health and also the health of database server hardware so they can identify and fix performance problems before they impact users. The insights gleaned from database monitoring can also inform developers how to make improvements to their application infrastructure and guarantee high performance.

In the following sections, we’ll look at how database monitoring works and outline the most important database metrics to monitor to optimize performance. We’ll also cover what kind of database monitoring tools are available and how to choose the best one for your organization.

## The Importance of Database Monitoring

Database monitoring is important because databases are an integral part of [modern IT infrastructure](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/it-infrastructure.html). Database issues can slow application and service response times and otherwise hamper their performance. Effective database monitoring helps you identify and quickly resolve performance issues so you can maintain database server [availability](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/availability.html) and ensure databases continuously provide organizations with the services and applications that drive their daily business.

## Improving & Maintaining Database Performance

Database performance describes the rate at which a database supplies information to the users requesting it. A database that meets this demand at a high rate is considered to be performing well. If it causes bottlenecks in a business process or an application, it is deemed to be performing poorly.

Many factors influence database performance, but five are particularly impactful. These include:

1.  **Workload**: Workload refers to the total volume of requests made by users and applications of a database. It can include various types of queries, batch jobs, online transactions, system commands and all other demands placed on the system at a given time. Workloads fluctuate dramatically over time, even from one second to the next. Occasionally, you can predict workload — for example, a heavier demand during seasonal shopping or end-of-month payroll processing and lighter demand after business hours — but most of the time workload is unpredictable.
2.  **Throughput**: Throughput describes the volume of work done by the database over time, typically measured as the number of queries executed per second, minute or hour. If a database’s throughput is lower than the number of incoming queries, it can overload the server and result in increased query response times, which in turn slow down a website or application. Throughput issues can indicate a need to optimize queries or upgrade the server.
3.  **Resources**: Resources are hardware and software tools used by the database. These include CPU, memory, cache controllers and microcode. The resources at the disposal of the database dramatically impact all the other database performance factors.
4.  **Optimization**: Optimization refers to the strategies used to increase the speed and efficiency with which information is retrieved from the database. Optimization practices include deleting unused tables, ensuring proper indexing, using appropriate data types and other database tuning techniques. Optimization is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, analysis and improvement.
5.  **Contention**: Contention occurs when two or more workload processes are trying to access the same data at the same time. In a SQL database, for example, contention results when multiple transactions try to update the same row simultaneously. If one transaction attempts to act on data that’s in the process of being changed by another, the database has to prohibit access to, or “lock,” the data until the change is complete to ensure the accuracy and consistency of that data. As contention increases, as is likely during periods of high demand, throughput decreases.

Ultimately, database administrators orchestrate these factors to ensure optimal database performance — optimizing resources to maximize throughput and minimize contention so that the database can efficiently process the largest possible workload.

![Five icons representing the five most important factors for database performance.](https://www.splunk.com/content/dam/splunk2/images/data-insider/database-monitoring/database-monitoring-performance-factors.jpg)

These five factors are especially important for database performance.

## Common Examples & Use Cases for Database Monitoring

Some examples of database monitoring include tracking:

-   Query response time
-   Database throughput
-   Errors
-   Open connections

These factors have a significant impact on the health of a database and how well it performs. Database monitoring also tracks whether a database is online and its resource consumption, both of which strongly impact the availability of the apps and services it supports.

## Benefits of Database Monitoring

Database monitoring offers organizations several benefits by helping identify problems such as:

-   Performance issues: Database monitoring helps database administrators identify slow and resource-intensive queries that bog down performance. They can use this information to tune particular queries or modify application logic to boost the database’s overall response time.
-   Resource shortages: Database monitoring tools can help you understand when you’re at risk of exceeding resource thresholds, enabling you to proactively address them. Common issues such as memory shortages and overworked CPUs can be resolved before they compromise performance or availability.
-   User access anomalies: Database monitoring can support security efforts by alerting database teams to uncharacteristic or suspicious user access patterns. These may signal malicious behavior by internal or external actors to compromise sensitive data. An uptick in failed logins, for example, could indicate a potential brute-force cyber attack and would warrant investigation.

## Challenges with Database Monitoring

The main challenge of database monitoring is determining what to monitor. While it’s tempting to monitor everything, this will overwhelm teams and make it difficult to know where to focus their optimization efforts. A good starting point is to start with monitoring the basic metrics outlined above along with any others that have a customer-facing impact.

## Database Monitoring Metrics & KPIs

As with other components of IT infrastructure, many metrics help indicate the health and performance of a database. Tracking all of them, though, would overwhelm IT administrators. Fortunately, you can get a good understanding of your database’s behavior by monitoring the basics. These include:

-   **Response time**: A critical metric for any database, response time measures the average response time per query for your database server. Database monitoring solutions usually represent this as a single number — 5.4 milliseconds, for example. Most tools will also let you measure the average response time for all queries on your database server or database instance, break the response time down by query type (select, insert, delete, update), and display these in graph form. Monitoring response time is important because it allows developers to identify how long sessions are waiting for database resources and helps them make better performance decisions to be proactive and discover root causes of performance issues.
-   **Database throughput**: As mentioned, throughput denotes the volume of work performed by your database server over a unit of time. It’s commonly measured as the number of queries executed per second. Monitoring throughput allows you to understand how quickly your server is processing incoming queries. Low throughput can overload your server and increase the response time for each query, ultimately bogging down your application or website. As with response time, most database monitoring solutions will allow you to monitor throughput for each of the most commonly used types of queries.
-   **Open connections**: Database connections enable communication between client software and the database, allowing applications to send queries, access database data sources, and receive responses. When a database server goes down, it’s often the result of too many open connections, which can overload and slow down the database server. Monitoring the number of open connections allows you to address the issue of too many connections before it compromises database performance.
-   **Errors**: Databases return an error each time a query doesn’t run successfully. Errors can cause a website or app to become inaccessible, which, depending on the affected service, can result in lost revenue, reduced productivity, or other negative business impacts. Monitoring errors can help you more quickly fix them and increase database availability. Database monitoring solutions allow you to track the number of queries for each error code so that you can see the most frequently occurring errors and determine how to resolve them.
-   **Most frequent queries**: Tracking the top 10 queries your database server receives along with their frequency and latency will enable you to optimize them for an easy performance boost.

There are many other database performance metrics, and there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to monitoring metrics. But the metrics listed here will provide any organization with a strong foundation to build upon.

![Icons that represent basic metrics to monitor for.](https://www.splunk.com/content/dam/splunk2/images/data-insider/database-monitoring/database-monitoring-metrics.jpg)

These are some of the foundational metrics you can start with to launch your database performance monitoring practice.

## Database Monitoring Implementations

Monitoring can be implemented throughout your system architecture and is customizable to suit your organizational needs. The most common implementations include:

-   **Resource monitoring**: Also referred to as server monitoring or [infrastructure monitoring](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/infrastructure-monitoring.html), this approach tracks system performance from your servers and other IT-related resources connected to your network. Resource monitoring solutions gather and report data on CPU load, RAM usage, remaining disk space, and other critical server metrics.
-   **Network monitoring**: [Network monitoring](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/network-monitoring.html) tracks the data going in and out of your network. Network monitoring tools gather all incoming requests and outgoing responses across all of the computer network's connected components such as routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and more. These solutions are analyzers that enable you to see the total volume of incoming and outgoing data as well as drill down to the frequency of specific requests.
-   **Application performance monitoring**: [Application performance monitoring](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/apm-application-performance-monitoring.html) (APM) allows you to gauge your applications’ performance on users’ devices, providing you with critical information around app availability. APM solutions collect data on how an overall service is performing, such as error rates, CPU usage, response times, and more. These tools work by sending requests to the service and tracking the speed and completeness of the response. APM enables you to detect and diagnose application performance issues before they impact users, ensuring app services achieve expected performance levels.
-   **Third-party component monitoring**: This approach monitors the health and availability of any third-party components in your architecture. This is particularly important in microservice-based architectures as their services rely on the proper functioning of cloud hosts, ad servers, and other external services. As with APM solutions, third-party component monitoring tools can send their own requests to third-party services to check their performance status.

Another consideration is whether to choose open-source or commercial monitoring software or tools. Open-source monitoring tools are advantageous for organizations concerned with pricing, and they also offer complete customization, making them easier to integrate into your existing architecture. The drawback of open-source monitoring tools is that they often require specialized skills and knowledge to implement and maintain, demanding more dedicated development time. Commercial tools, while costly, come with more robust features and support. In addition to managing their solution, providers will offer ample training and customer service and generally help you integrate their tool with your existing stack.

## Database Monitoring Best Practices

You can maximize your database monitoring efforts by following a few best practices, including:.

-   **Monitor availability and resource consumption**: The most basic monitoring practice is to regularly check that databases are online, during both business and non-business hours. Most monitoring tools will do this automatically and alert teams to an outage. Monitoring resource consumption including CPU, memory, disk, and network is also important, so you can be alerted to any issues before they compromise performance.
-   **Monitor slow queries**: Improving slow queries is one of the easiest ways to boost application performance. Tracking the time needed for a query to complete, as well as measuring the resource usage for queries, will provide the necessary insights into database query performance. Start with the most popular queries, as they will have the biggest impact on database performance.
-   **Measure throughput**: As mentioned, throughput refers to the volume of work the database is doing under normal conditions. Establish a baseline by taking readings at intervals over several weeks. These baseline measurements can then be used to set alert thresholds so teams can be notified when there’s an unexpected variation from normal values, prompting them to investigate.
-   **Monitor logs**: Database logs contain a wealth of information, so it’s important to collect all of them, including slow query logs, scheduled task logs and routine maintenance logs. Log information will help you identify and resolve the cause of errors and failure, identify performance trends, predict potential issues, and even uncover malicious activity. Manually parsing the volume of log data produced by database systems isn’t possible, but a good database monitoring tool will be able to present relevant data in dashboard visualizations so teams can easily understand and act on insights.

## Getting Started With Database Monitoring

To get started with database monitoring, you’ll need a monitoring tool. The breadth of available options — from tools that address one type of system component to all-in-one solutions — can be overwhelming and complicate your purchasing decision. To help hone in on your needs and narrow down the options, consider the following questions:

-   What components — network, server, application — do you need to monitor?
-   What kind of data do you need to collect and correlate?
-   Do you only want to observe patterns over time or also be alerted to critical problems?
-   What level of support does your organization need?
-   What is your budget for monitoring?
-   Will you be monitoring an on-premises (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or a Microsoft SQL Server) or cloud environment (such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon RDS, Google Cloud, AWS, Amazon Aurora or Oracle Cloud) — or both?

## The Bottom Line: Database monitoring is essential for ensuring app availability

Databases are the backbone of modern organizations. Deteriorating performance can slow your applications and services and ultimately have negative consequences for your business. Database monitoring provides the visibility you need to ensure availability, optimize performance, and ensure the best experience for your users.

![](https://www.splunk.com/libs/clientlibs/granite/richtext/resources/images/blank.png)Let's learn more. 

## What is data monitoring?

Data monitoring is [observing and tracking data](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/data-observability.html) to verify whether it's accurate, [quality-ensured](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/data-quality.html), and integrated. Doing so can help you identify and address issues, make better decisions, and maintain the reliability of data-driven processes.

You can monitor the following types of information to detect anomalies, trends, or patterns that may require attention: 

-   Metrics
-   [Performance indicators](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/kpis-key-performance-indicators.html)
-   System logs

([_Explore the differences between logs and metrics_](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/logs-vs-metrics.html).)

### Benefits of data monitoring 

Monitoring data allows you to spot problems and fix them. It's like having a watchdog that looks for issues that might affect the company's operations or decision-making. 

And constant monitoring helps maintain high-quality data and ensure that it meets previously established standards for formatting and consistency.

Here are some reasons why data monitoring is essential:

-   **Saves time and money**: Monitoring stored data saves time and money by avoiding resource-intensive pre-processing.
-   **Improves data quality**: Data monitoring helps maintain high data quality by detecting and correcting issues before they become significant problems.
-   **Supports governance initiatives**: Data monitoring [ensures adherence to standards and protocols](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/data-governance-vs-data-management.html) while providing actionable insights through dashboards, alerts, and reports.
-   **Helps connect better with customers**: Accurate information improves customer connections through reliable data monitoring.
-   **Identifies errors before they cause harm**: Monitoring data quality helps prevent mistakes that can lead to wrong decisions, resource waste, and legal issues.
-   **![](https://www.splunk.com/libs/clientlibs/granite/richtext/resources/images/blank.png)Provides accountability**: Monitoring helps track resources and results. It generates early warnings, recommends improvements, and evaluates program effectiveness.

## How data monitoring works

Data monitoring works by reviewing data to check its accuracy and quality. It's an ongoing process that requires consistent attention and adaptation. So, here's how you can monitor data: 

1.  **Identify what to monitor for your business goals**. It could be sales figures, [website traffic](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/web-analytics.html), customer feedback, or other relevant information.
2.  **Set up monitoring tools to track and collect data automatically**. These tools can range from basic spreadsheets to advanced analytics platforms.
3.  **Establish monitoring parameters for normal or acceptable data**. This helps in detecting any deviations or anomalies that require amendments.
4.  [**Collect and analyze data**](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/data-analytics.html) weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly to identify patterns, trends, or irregularities that require further investigation.
5.  **![](https://www.splunk.com/libs/clientlibs/granite/richtext/resources/images/blank.png)Act upon insights when any issues or opportunities are detected**. This will help you resolve problems and optimize processes to improve business outcomes.

## Improve data quality with data monitoring 

Improving your company's data means making it reliable and free from errors, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outdated information. By doing so, you'll have more accurate data to support your company's decision-making processes and operational activities.

Here's what you should do to improve the company's data quality with monitoring:

**Detect and correct errors** such as missing values, incorrect formatting, or outliers. Once you detect these issues, take appropriate actions to rectify the errors and ensure data accuracy.

**Identify anomalies** to understand data quality issues like entry errors or system malfunctions. By promptly [identifying and investigating these anomalies](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/anomaly-detection.html), you can address underlying quality problems and prevent them from affecting decision-making processes.

**Ensure data completeness** by verifying that all required fields are populated and complete. This way, you can fill in any gaps and make sure that your data is comprehensive.

This includes defining data ownership, stewardship roles, and quality policies guiding data management practices.

## Best practices for data monitoring

To establish an effective data monitoring strategy that helps you manage your data, detect issues early, and make decisions, here are some best practices to follow:

### Define clear objectives 

Start with defining your data monitoring objectives and goals. Identify the key metrics, performance indicators, or anomalies you want to track. This helps to focus on the most critical aspects of data and avoid unnecessary hurdles.

### Select relevant data sources

Choose the data sources that are most relevant to your objectives. Determine which systems, [databases](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/database-vs-data-warehouse.html), applications, or sensors provide the data you need to monitor. By selecting suitable sources, you can ensure that you're collecting meaningful and actionable information.

### Set realistic thresholds

Set appropriate thresholds or benchmarks to define your data's normal or abnormal behavior. These thresholds should be based on historical data, industry standards, or predefined business rules. And this will help you identify deviations and abnormalities accurately.

### Establish timely alerts

Configure alerts to notify you promptly when data anomalies or critical events occur. Make sure that the alerts are sent to the right people who can act against them because this will prevent potential issues from escalating.

### Use visualization tools

Visualizations help you quickly identify trends, patterns, or outliers. They also make it easier for others to understand what you're representing. So, choose tools that provide suitable visualizations for data and make spotting anomalies or problems more manageable.

(_Looking at outputs to understand the internal system is a backbone of good data practice — [we call it observability](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/data-observability.html)_.)

### Regularly review and refine

Perform regular audits of your data monitoring approach to assess the following: 

-   Relevance of the monitored metrics. 
-   The effectiveness of alerts. 
-   The usefulness of the visualizations. 

Stay open to adjusting and improving based on feedback and changing business needs.

### Collaborate and communicate 

Foster collaboration and communication between different teams involved in data monitoring. And encourage others to share insights, knowledge, and best practices. 

You should also establish clear channels for communication and ensure that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.

### Ensure [data security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/data-security.html) and compliance 

Make sure to keep the data safe and only allow authorized people to access it when monitoring it. Follow the laws and privacy rules that apply to your monitoring practices and [encrypt the data](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/end-to-end-encryption.html) to protect it.

([_Some organizations pursue compliance as a service_](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/caas-compliance-as-a-service.html).)

### Monitor performance impact

## Automated data monitoring systems

An automated data monitoring system collects, analyzes, and reports data types in real-time or near real-time. It monitors and tracks data from multiple sources, such as:

-   Databases
-   Applications
-   Servers
-   Networks
-   IoT devices

And an automated data monitoring system ensures the availability, performance, and integrity of data within an organization. It helps detect and resolve issues, optimize system performance, and ensure compliance with predefined business rules.

Here's what an automated data monitoring system can do:

-   Collect data from various sources.
-   Monitor data for anomalies, errors, or deviations.
-   Generate alerts or notifications when an issue is detected.
-   Analyze data to identify trends, patterns, or potential problems.
-   Help to identify bottlenecks or performance issues and suggest optimizations.
-   Ensure data handling and processing adhere to regulation and security standards.
-   Maintain historical data repository for analysis and audit purposes.
-   Integrate with existing systems and is scalable to handle increasing data volumes or sources.

How does it work?

The three core elements that make up an automated data monitoring system:

-   Data collection
-   Data analysis and monitoring
-   Alerting and reporting

Combining these three core elements—the automated system will help your organization manage its data infrastructure and address issues promptly. 

Here's how the system works:

### Data collection

The data monitoring system collects and consolidates data from different sources for analysis. These sources could include databases, applications, servers, network devices, log files, APIs, and IoT sensors. 

(_Performance monitoring is different across systems — [see how different network and application monitoring can be](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/network-vs-application-performance-monitoring.html)_.)

Like data sources, there are diversified data collection methods, too. So the system will choose the one that suits its data source.

Some standard data collection methods are: 

-   Querying databases
-   Capturing log files
-   Using APIs to retrieve data from external systems 
-   Utilizing specialized connectors for specific applications

### Data analysis and monitoring

Once the data is collected, the automated system analyzes it in real-time or near real-time. The analysis involves applying predefined rules, thresholds, or algorithms to detect anomalies, errors, patterns, or trends. 

To do so, your system should have advanced analytics capabilities like statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and pattern recognition to process and interpret the collected data efficiently.

### Alerting and reporting

The automated data monitoring system generates alerts or notifications when an issue or abnormality is detected during the data analysis phase. These alerts are sent to [system administrators](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/system-administrator-sysadmin-role.html), IT support teams, or business users to take immediate action. 

Alerting helps to ensure that responsible individuals are promptly informed about data anomalies that require attention. The system should have:

-   Configurable alerting mechanisms.
-   Ability to allow users to define thresholds.
-   Notification channels (such as email, SMS, or instant messaging).
-   Escalation procedures.

And the data monitoring system also generates reports or visualizations to provide insights into the monitored data. These reports can include dashboards, charts, graphs, or summary statistics to help stakeholders understand the current state of the data. 

This further assists them with identifying trends and making informed decisions.

## Data monitoring in a nutshell

Data monitoring is vital for businesses to ensure accurate and reliable data, make informed decisions, optimize processes, and mitigate risks. By implementing monitoring best practices, and utilizing automated data monitoring systems, companies can improve data quality, detect issues promptly and maintain a robust data infrastructure.
