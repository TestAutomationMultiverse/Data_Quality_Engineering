**Probability:**

Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that an event is impossible and 1 indicating that an event is certain to happen. For example, the probability of flipping a fair coin and it landing on heads is 0.5, or 50%. This is because there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and they are equally likely to occur.
