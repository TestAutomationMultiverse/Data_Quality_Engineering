# Statistics:

In data science, statistics is used in a wide range of tasks, such as data exploration, data cleaning, feature selection, model selection and evaluation, and hypothesis testing.

For example, when exploring a dataset, a data scientist might use descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to get a sense of the overall distribution of the data. In the process of cleaning and preparing the data, statistical techniques such as outliers detection, missing value imputation, and normalization may be used.

In the feature selection process, a data scientist can use statistical methods such as correlation and regression analysis to identify which variables are most important for the problem at hand.

When it comes to model selection, data scientists use statistical techniques such as cross-validation and A/B testing to ensure that their model is generalizable and performs well on unseen data.

In short, statistics is an essential tool for data scientists, as it provides the means to extract insights and make predictions from data.

#### **Inferential statistics:**

Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with making inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It involves using probability and statistical models to make predictions or estimates about a population from sample data. This is done by using statistical methods to draw conclusions about the population from the sample data. Some common inferential statistical techniques include hypothesis testing, estimation, and correlation analysis. These techniques are used to make predictions, estimate population parameters, and draw conclusions about the population based on the sample data.

Here is an example of inferential statistics in action:

Imagine a researcher wants to know the average income of all adults in a certain city. It would be impractical to survey every adult in the city, so instead they take a sample of 1000 adults and record their income. Using inferential statistics, the researcher can use this sample data to make inferences about the entire population of adults in the city.

The researcher calculates the mean income of the sample, which is $50,000. The researcher also calculates the standard deviation of the sample, which is $10,000. With this information, the researcher can use inferential statistical methods to estimate the mean income of all adults in the city and also calculate the margin of error.

For example, using a z-test and assuming a normal distribution, the researcher can estimate that the average income of all adults in the city is likely between $49,500 and $50,500, with a 95% level of confidence.

**Descriptive statistics:**

Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with describing and summarizing the characteristics of a sample of data. It is used to describe and summarize the sample data, and does not involve making inferences about a population.

Types of Descriptive Statistics:

-   Measure of Central Tendency
-   Measure of Variability

An example of descriptive statistics in action is:

A researcher wants to describe the height of students in a certain school. They measure the height of a sample of 100 students. Using descriptive statistics, the researcher can summarize the height data by calculating measures such as the mean, median, and mode of the sample. They can also create a frequency distribution table and a histogram to show the distribution of the height data.

The researcher finds that the mean height is 5.6 feet, the median height is 5.5 feet, and the mode height is 5.6 feet. They also find that most of the students have a height between 5.4 and 5.8 feet.

This is just one example of how descriptive statistics can be used to describe and summarize data.
