# Test Plan

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this test plan is to define the strategy and scope for testing the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process of the \[Project Name\]. The objective is to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and performance of the ETL pipeline in compliance with the specified business and technical requirements.

### **1.2 Objectives**

-   Validate that extracted data is complete, accurate, and timely.
-   Ensure all business transformation rules are correctly implemented.
-   Verify that loaded data meets schema requirements and is correctly structured in the target system.
-   Confirm the ETL process handles large volumes of data and fails gracefully when exceptions occur.

### **1.3 Scope**

The plan covers:

-   Extraction from \[Source Systems: e.g., Oracle DB, Flat Files\].
-   Transformation of data per defined rules (e.g., currency conversion, deduplication).
-   Loading data into the target system (e.g., a data warehouse like Snowflake or Redshift).
-   Validation of data integrity, accuracy, and completeness across the ETL pipeline.

Out of Scope:

-   Modifications to source systems beyond providing test data.
-   Application or end-user layer validation (e.g., BI tools, dashboards).

## **2\. Test Approach**

### **2.1 High-Level Testing Process**

1.  **Requirement Analysis**: Identify testable requirements from functional and technical specifications.
2.  **Test Design**: Develop test cases for extraction, transformation, loading, and overall data validation.
3.  **Execution**: Run test cases manually or using automation frameworks.
4.  **Defect Management**: Log defects, track resolution, and retest.
5.  **Sign-Off**: Obtain stakeholder approval after all critical issues are resolved.

### **2.2 Testing Tools**

**Tool**

**Purpose**

**Informatica**

ETL execution and workflow validation.

**QuerySurge**

Automated data validation and reconciliation.

**SQL Developer**

Writing and executing SQL for data validation.

**Apache JMeter**

Load testing ETL workflows for performance validation.

**Dataedo**

Data lineage and schema comparison.

**Python/Pandas**

Custom scripts for detailed data reconciliation.

### **2.3 Test Levels**

1.  **Unit Testing**: Verify individual ETL components (e.g., single job or transformation logic).
2.  **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components (Extract → Transform → Load).
3.  **System Testing**: Validate the entire ETL workflow with realistic datasets.
4.  **Regression Testing**: Confirm no new defects are introduced during ETL changes.
5.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Validate that the ETL pipeline aligns with business requirements.

## **3\. Test Scenarios**

### **3.1 High-Level Scenarios**

**Scenario**

**Description**

**End-to-End Workflow Validation**

Validate the entire ETL process for correctness and alignment with requirements.

**Incremental Data Loads**

Ensure only new and updated records are processed in incremental loads.

**Data Transformation Rules Validation**

Confirm all business rules are implemented correctly (e.g., date format conversion).

**Error Handling and Logging**

Verify appropriate error messages and recovery mechanisms when issues occur.

**Schema Validation**

Check that data loaded into the target matches the schema requirements.

**Duplicate Handling**

Ensure duplicate data is correctly identified and managed (e.g., removed or flagged).

**Boundary and Negative Testing**

Test edge cases, null values, invalid data, and schema mismatches.

**Data Volume Testing**

Verify ETL performance and stability under large data loads.

### **3.2 Detailed Scenarios**

#### **Extraction**

-   Verify full and incremental data extraction processes retrieve accurate datasets.
-   Test extraction under different network conditions.

#### **Transformation**

-   Validate calculated fields (e.g., totals, averages, ratios) match expected values.
-   Test proper application of lookup tables for enrichment.

#### **Loading**

-   Validate target table row counts match expectations.
-   Confirm data loading adheres to indexing and partitioning rules in the target system.

#### **Performance Testing**

-   Test ETL jobs with production-scale datasets to ensure completion within SLAs.
-   Measure the impact of simultaneous job execution on system performance.

#### **Error Handling**

-   Simulate source system downtime and verify the retry mechanism.
-   Check error logs for clarity and completeness.
